## 📖 Overview

The **Helix Wave Framework** is an original interdisciplinary model that integrates Sanatan Dharma and Vedic principles with modern fields like ethical AI, governance innovation, quantum-informed policy, and decolonized knowledge systems.

### Core Concept

- **Helix** = Spiral, layered evolution of knowledge
- **Wave** = How ideas spread, resonate, and create impact over time

Together, they form a structured, ethical, and evidence-based approach to innovation rooted in dharmic values.

### Dharma as a Universal Principle of Order: A Philosophical and Systemic Reinterpretation Beyond Religion, Morality, and Ritual

**Published:** February 5, 2026 | **DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.18498639](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18498639)

This groundbreaking paper presents a revolutionary philosophical framework redefining **Dharma** not as religion or morality, but as a **universal principle of order, knowledge, balance, and functional responsibility**. 

**Key Contributions:**
- **New Definition of Dharma** - First comprehensive redefinition as a cross-cultural analytical concept
- **Dharma vs Religion** - Clear differentiation challenging conventional interpretations
- **Cosmological Framework** - Original analysis of creation of the universe through Dharmic lens
- **Universal Application** - Bridges ancient wisdom with contemporary philosophy, science, and social theory

**Abstract:**  
The term Dharma is frequently interpreted as synonymous with religion, morality, or cultural practice. Such interpretations restrict its conceptual scope. This paper proposes an alternative philosophical framework in which Dharma is understood as a universal principle of order, knowledge, balance, and functional responsibility. By examining natural law, human behavior, education, ritual practices, ethics, and cosmology, Dharma is redefined as the sustaining logic that maintains coherence within complex systems.

**Encyclopedic Significance:**  
This work provides foundational definitions suitable for inclusion in philosophical encyclopedias, offering a rigorous, scholarly reinterpretation of Dharma that transcends cultural boundaries and applies to universal systems of order and knowledge.
